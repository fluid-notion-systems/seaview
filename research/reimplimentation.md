## Next Steps

1. **Review and refine this plan** with stakeholders
2. **Set up development environment** and CI/CD
3. **Create project repository** with initial structure
4. **Begin Phase 1** implementation
5. **Establish regular progress reviews**

This reimplementation will result in a modern, maintainable, and performant mesh visualization tool that exceeds the capabilities of the original mesh-ripper while addressing its limitations.
