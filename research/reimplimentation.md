5. **Modern Rust**: Use latest idioms and best practices

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **ECS Architecture**: Leverage Bevy's ECS for all systems
2. **Async First**: Use async for all I/O operations
3. **GPU Compute**: Utilize GPU for particle processing
4. **Zero-Copy**: Minimize data copying for performance
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work everywhere

### Technology Stack:
- **Bevy 0.16**: Latest stable version (updated from 0.14)
- **wgpu**: Modern graphics API
- **egui**: Immediate mode UI
- **rfd**: Native file dialogs
- **notify**: File system watching
- **serde**: Configuration serialization
- **stl_io**: STL file format support
- **bevy_brp_extras**: Remote protocol support

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **Bevy API Changes**: Maintain compatibility layer
2. **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking
3. **Memory Usage**: Implement strict limits
4. **File Format Compatibility**: Extensive testing
5. **Platform Differences**: CI for all platforms

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Incremental development with working versions

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 1 foundation** - focus on file discovery and additional format support
2. **Create abstraction layer** for mesh loading plugins
3. **Implement PLY and OBJ loaders** as separate plugins
4. **Design sequence detection system** for Phase 2
5. **Establish performance benchmarks** early

This reimplementation will result in a modern, maintainable, and performant mesh visualization tool that exceeds the capabilities of the original mesh-ripper while addressing its limitations.
