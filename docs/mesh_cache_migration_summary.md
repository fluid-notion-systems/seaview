# MeshCache to AsyncMeshCache Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Seaview application from using the synchronous `MeshCache` to the new asynchronous `AsyncMeshCache` with parallel STL loading capabilities. This migration enables non-blocking STL file loading on multiple worker threads while maintaining UI responsiveness.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Core Infrastructure

- **Added AsyncStlLoaderPlugin**: Integrated into the main application to provide multi-threaded loading infrastructure
- **Replaced MeshCache with AsyncMeshCache**: Throughout the codebase, providing async-aware caching with LRU eviction
- **Updated Plugin Dependencies**: Modified `SequenceLoaderPlugin` to use async components

### 2. Module Updates

#### `sequence/loader.rs`
- Replaced `MeshCache` resource with `AsyncMeshCache`
- Updated imports to include async components
- Modified `preload_sequence_meshes` to queue files with priority-based loading
- Updated `handle_frame_changes` to check cache and queue loads asynchronously
- Removed synchronous `update_cache_stats` in favor of async `log_cache_stats`
- Added integration with `LoadCompleteEvent` system

#### `systems/stl_loader/mod.rs`
- Updated to use `AsyncMeshCache` instead of `MeshCache`
- Changed from synchronous loading to queuing with `AsyncStlLoader`
- Added `handle_initial_load_complete` system to spawn mesh entities when loads complete
- Removed direct mesh creation in favor of event-driven approach

#### `main.rs`
- Added `AsyncStlLoaderPlugin` to the application plugin list
- Plugin order ensures async loader is initialized before other systems

### 3. New Event-Driven Architecture

The migration introduces an event-driven architecture for mesh loading:

1. **Queue Phase**: Systems queue STL files for loading with priorities
2. **Load Phase**: Worker threads process files in parallel
3. **Complete Phase**: `LoadCompleteEvent` fired when loads finish
4. **Spawn Phase**: Systems handle events to create mesh entities

### 4. Priority System

Implemented intelligent loading priorities:
- `Critical`: Current frame being displayed
- `High`: Frames within 2 frames of current
- `Normal`: Frames within 5 frames of current
- `Low`: All other frames

### 5. Public API Changes

Made `last_displayed_frame` field public in `AsyncMeshCache` to maintain compatibility with existing frame tracking logic.

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Non-blocking Loading**: UI remains responsive during STL loading
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple files load simultaneously on worker threads
3. **Intelligent Prefetching**: Priority-based loading ensures needed frames load first
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved with improved performance

## Migration Path for Other Components

To migrate additional components to use async loading:

1. Replace `MeshCache` with `AsyncMeshCache` in resource declarations
2. Change `get_or_load()` calls to `get_or_queue()` with appropriate priority
3. Add event handlers for `LoadCompleteEvent` to process completed loads
4. Remove synchronous loading logic in favor of event-driven approach

## Performance Implications

- **Startup**: Initial STL loads no longer block application startup
- **Sequence Loading**: Frame sequences load in parallel with smart prioritization
- **Memory Usage**: Same LRU cache eviction strategy maintains memory bounds
- **CPU Utilization**: Better multi-core usage with configurable worker threads

## Future Enhancements

1. Add progress indicators for individual file loads
2. Implement adaptive worker thread count based on system load
3. Add cancellation support for unnecessary loads
4. Integrate streaming for very large STL files

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various STL file sizes to verify performance improvements
2. Verify UI responsiveness during sequence loading
3. Monitor memory usage with large sequences
4. Test error handling for corrupted or missing files
5. Verify correct frame display order with async loading

The migration is complete and the application now benefits from true parallel, non-blocking STL file loading while maintaining all existing functionality.
